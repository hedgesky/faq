I had some troubles with searching for reliable information on the topic, because a lot of websites provide only basic info and suggest to buy their help with preparing the documents. However, the overall process turned out to be rather easy:

1. Obtain Cl@ve by following instructions at https://clave.gob.es/clave_Home/en/clave.html. Basically, you install Cl@vePin app on your phone, but to activate it, they send a special code over physical mail. So better do it right away to save time. Cl@ve allows you to identify yourself on governmental websites, so in general it proved to be useful.

2. Then you go to https://www.agenciatributaria.gob.es/AEAT.sede/tramitacion/G606.shtml, click Presentación, and follow instructions. It's Agencia Tributaria website with the form called "Modelo 149", which allows you to sign up for Special Taxation Regime.

3. There's not a lot of information on how to fill up that form; I used common sense, and it worked fine. I knew in advance that I have to present some additional documents to the application form, but the form didn't have fields for that. More on that below.

4. Once I submitted that form, they gave me a pdf with submission number. Eventually, they replied me saying that they need those additional documents. I've submitted them by using the above link, but clicking on "Aportar documentación". Probably you might do that right away, not waiting for their initial request.

The important thing is that you can only apply for it during first 6 months of being in Spain. There's some useful information in English at https://www.barcelona.cat/internationalwelcome/en/need/taxes ("Special tax system applicable" section).

Also, using Chrome browser and translating the form right in place really helped me.
